To fully enjoy this theme, please follow the configuration instructions in Playnite:

In the theme folder, you'll find a folder called "Theme Option". You can change the theme design (with or without trailers, etc...), simply by copying the "view" folder (from the corresponding zip file) into the main theme directory.

For filter icons to appear correctly, the filter name and icon.png name must match !
To modify the icons (those located at the bottom of the screen), open: [Aniki Theme\Icons\Filter], choose and rename (or add) any .png with the name corresponding to your filters ( Filter: "my games" = "my games.png"). 
For source icons (those located at the Top of the screen), the folder is [Aniki Theme\Icons\Source].
