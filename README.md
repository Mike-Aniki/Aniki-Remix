# ‚ö†Ô∏è End of updates for Aniki Remix ‚ö†Ô∏è

Please note that the Aniki-Remix theme will no longer receive updates. However, it remains fully functional and you can continue to use it if you wish.

That said, I strongly recommend you move on to Aniki Remake, my most accomplished theme. With its many customization options, Aniki Remake lets you recreate exactly the same rendering as Remix, while benefiting from regular improvements and updates.

### Why switch to Aniki ReMake ?

- Aniki Remake offers over 25 different interfaces and more than 25 animated login screens, as well as numerous customization options.
- You can adjust settings to match Remix's look and feel, or explore new options to make your interface unique.
- Designed to offer a complete console experience on the PC, it is particularly optimized for joystick users.

Finally, I'd like to extend my warmest thanks to all those who have supported Aniki Remix, either by using it or by sharing your feedback. This theme has been an important step in my creative journey and has enabled me to create Aniki Remake. Your enthusiasm has been an incredible source of motivation.
