To fully enjoy this theme, please follow the configuration instructions in Playnite:

	- To change the theme layout: In the theme folder, you'll find a folder called "Theme Option". Simply copy the "view" folder (from the corresponding zip file) into the main theme folder.

	- To change the interface style (bottom bars) : Go to the [Aniki Remix\Theme Option\Bottom bars] folder. Choose the style you like and copy and paste the corresponding "interface.png" file into the [Aniki ReMake\Images] folder.

For filter icons to appear correctly, the filter name and icon.png name must match !

	- To modify the icons (those located at the bottom of the screen), open: [Aniki Remix\Icons\Filter], choose and rename (or add) any .png with the name 	corresponding to your filters ( Filter: "my games" = "my games.png"). 

	- For source icons (those located at the Top of the screen), the folder is [Aniki Remix\Icons\Source].

	- To modify your avatar, go to the [Aniki Theme\Theme OptionAvatar] folder, select the avatar you want (or import one of your own), rename it "Avatar.png", 	then replace the file of the same name in the [Aniki Remix\Images] folder. 

	- To modify menu navigation audio files, access the [Aniki Remix\Audio] folder. You must rename your file exactly as the file you wish to replace. To disable these sounds, rename or delete the audio files.
